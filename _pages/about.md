Yuyao Song is a PhD candidate at [EMBL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/yuyao-song/) working with [Prof Irene Papatheodorou](https://www.earlham.ac.uk/profile/irene-papatheodorou) and [Prof Detlev Arendt](https://www.embl.org/groups/arendt/). Her primary research focus lies in **cross-species comparison of cell types using single cell transcriptomics data**. She has developed computational frameworks to tackle the conservation and divergence of cell type expression profiles across species, from the perspective of evolution and functional genomics. Currently, she is working on devising a novel analysis paradigm leveraging knowledge graphs.

In her day-to-day work, she develops softwares and analyze data using `Python` and `R`. She also develops `Nextflow` pipelines with `Docker`/`Singularity` containers. She is now working with `Neo4j`, `NetworkX` and `PyG`. She programs ~50% of the time, writes 25% of the time, reads 15% of the time and talks 10% of the time (ideally).

She spends most of her free time exploring nature and culture across the globe. She is particularly enthusiastic about concerts and opera. She enjoys going to science and art museums, reading true history books and dancing. She deeply loves the sea, more so at night.
